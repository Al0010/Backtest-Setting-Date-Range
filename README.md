# BacktestSettingDateRange
Script for the strategy in Pine that allows you to adjust the time period under analysis. 

By adding this script you will be able to analyse a specific range period. You can isolate a short period to monitor how the strategy performed in a specific market phase (e.g. bearish) or you can analyse the entire history. Surely this script will be able to optimise your research. 

Installation is very easy. Just copy and paste the script into your Pine console. This script can be used for both the 4.00 and 5.00 versions of Pine. Once you have pasted the script to your project you can configure the analysis period via the friendly user interface.
