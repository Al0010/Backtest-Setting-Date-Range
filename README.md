# BacktestSettingDateRange
Script for backtesting Strategy in Pine. Adjust the time Range period under analysis. 

By adding this script you will be able to analyse a specific range period. You can isolate a short period to monitor how the strategy performed in a specific market phase (ex bearish market period) or you can analyse the entire history. Surely this script will be able to optimise your research. 

Installation is very easy. Just copy and paste the script into your Pine console. This script can be used for V.5 versions of Pine. Once you have pasted the script to your project you can configure the analysis period via the friendly user interface.
